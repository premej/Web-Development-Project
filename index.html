		<h3>About Vitamins</h3>
		<p>The 13 vitamins your body needs are vitamin A, C, D, E, K, B1 (Thiamine), B2 (Riboflavin), B3 (Niacin), B5 (Pantothenic Acid), B6 (Pyridoxine), B7 (Biotin), B9 (Folate) and B12 (Cobalamin).
			Vitamins are essential micronutrients that are needed for normal cell function, growth, and development. Deficiencies can occur over the course of weeks to months, therefore it’s important to consume them regularly through a healthy diet, and supplements if needed. 
			Each vitamin has unique functions in the body and can be found in a variety of different foods.</p>
		<p><i>Our additional feature is giving the knowledge of sources of vitamins in various items.</i></p>
