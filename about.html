    <p id="big-paragraph">I'm C Prem Sai studying in B.tech third year. I'm more passionate about creating new web pages. So, After learning web development from multiple sources
        i came to know that, Doing work on it makes it clear more than learning virtual and understanding things. So, I decided to do a project in Web development field, As I learned only front-end development i can only create the user-interactive interface.
        But learning Javascript makes me to do an activity which allows you to select the type of vitamin and display the information about the particular vitamin, the Information includes sources
        of food items and the body organs connected/linked to the vitamins, and it tells us to which food item should we have to eat for not to get deficiency in that vitamin.
        Coming to the main purpose of the website is to find the medcine properties, which includes informations about<i> Name, Properties, Dosage, description</i>. As we have many tablets in our home, but we don't know the property of it, that is use of the medicine.
        So, I used to think of this situation try to build a website on this problem. Important Note: Don't completely depend on the information in this website, It will suggest you to take some suggestions from the doctor. I Hope you will enjoy my work, don't feel to contact me for any clarifications ,or telling any errors.Jai Hind!!!
